## Importance of data visualization
Although data visualization is a powerful tool for making data more understandable, actionable, and memorable, displaying data in a wrong way causes ambiguity and confusion. In this project, I tried to change the code in order to best convey the message from a particular perspective.

## Solutions
1.	I changed the Whitehat.js file to show the map of the US which indicates the location and normalized number of deaths according to the population of each state and city (per 100000 people) by the colors from green (the state or which has the lowest number of deaths) to red (the state or which has the highest number of deaths). Normalizing the number of deaths with considering the population of each state and correcting the coloring of states based on the normalized number of deaths are two important things to convey the right information better.
2.	Moreover, black circles show the location (a tooltip show the name of the city) and the number of deaths. The size of the circle relates directly to the number of deaths.
3.	Whitehatstats.js was modified by me to displays the number of states deaths in a comparative way with considering the gender of the deaths in each state.
